 *    most recently edited ones rather than an arbitrary slice.
 * 2. Unlike the fail-soft reads it sits next to, it THROWS on failure instead
 *    of returning []. That is deliberate and load-bearing: the caller has to
 *    be able to distinguish "nothing matched" from "this server does not
 *    support the op" so `createLatchedFallback` below can latch the capability

 *

 * deployed to production yet, so against prod EVERY search would otherwise pay
 * a doomed round trip and log a fresh warning. One attempt is enough to learn

 *
 * It deliberately over-latches: a transient network blip disables the pushdown
 * for the session even though the op is fine. That trade is correct here — the
 * cost of being wrong is degrading to the widened client-side scan (what these
 * providers did before the pushdown existed), while the cost of NOT latching
 * is a guaranteed failed request on every keystroke forever against a server
 * that lacks the op. Discriminating on error code would be a cross-repo change
 * spanning the SDK's error hierarchy and unified-api; it is not this seam's
 * job to guess.
 *

 * the recent-window listing without a failing match taking the whole search
 * down with it. The first failure latches and logs ONCE; every later call
 * skips the attempt entirely rather than re-paying it.
 *
 * Pass `fn` as a thunk that re-reads its dependency at call time (e.g.

 * ── Key omission ──
 * Fields left undefined are OMITTED rather than emitted as `undefined` keys, so
 * the hit JSON-serializes to exactly what the provider meant. `snippet` follows
 * `text || undefined` — an empty excerpt is not a snippet — while `preview.data`
